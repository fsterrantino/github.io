## Objective
The objective of the project it's to be able to create a normalized dimensional model from two raw CSVs files with NBA data and load them as tables in a simple Snowflake Data Warehouse.

## Description
The dimensional model established is two JPG files:
• Raw: Raw_data.jpg
• Modeled data: Dimensional_model.jpg

All the process is made with DBT and loaded into Snowflake. The raw files were loaded as seeds and transformed with model files to be loaded as normalized tables.
